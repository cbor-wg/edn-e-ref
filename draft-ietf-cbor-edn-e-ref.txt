    External References to Values in CBOR Diagnostic Notation (EDN)
                    draft-ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref-latest

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   CBOR diagnostic notation (EDN) is widely used to represent CBOR data
   items in a way that is accessible to humans, for instance for
   examples in a specification.  At the time of writing, EDN did not
   provide mechanisms for composition of such examples from multiple
   components or sources.  This document uses EDN application extensions
   to provide two such mechanisms, both of which insert an imported data
   item into the data item being described in EDN:

   The e'' application extension provides a way to import data items,
   particularly constant values, from a CDDL model (which itself has
   ways to provide composition).

   The ref'' application extension provides a way to import data items
   that are described in EDN.

1.  Introduction

   (Please see abstract.)  [RFC8949] [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]

   See [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers] for a more general discussion of
   working with assigned numbers during development of a specification.

2.  The e'' application extension: importing from CDDL

Problem

   In diagnostic notation examples used during development of earlier
   drafts, authors often used text strings in place of constants they
   need, even though they actually mean a placeholder for a later, to-
   be-registered integer.

   One example from a recent draft would be:

   {
       "group_mode" : true,
       "gp_enc_alg" : 10,
             "hkdf" : 5
   }

         Figure 1: Misleading usage of text strings as stand-in for
                            registered constants

   Not only is the reader misled by seeing text strings in places that
   are actually intended to be small integers, there are also small
   integers that are not explained at all (here: 10, 5).  The usefulness
   of this example is greatly reduced.  Examples constructed in this are
   not actually machine-readable -- they seem to be, but they mean the
   wrong thing in several places without any warning that this is so.

Solution

   In many cases, the constants needed to clean up this example are
   already available in a CDDL model, or could be easily made available
   in this way.

   If such a CDDL model can be identified, the EDN application extension
   e'constant-name' can be used to reference a constant defined by that
   model under the name constant-name.  (Hint: memorize the e as
   external constant, or enum.)

Internet-Draft           EDN external references           December 2024


   For the example in Figure 1, such a CDDL model could have at least
   the content shown in Figure 2:

   group_mode = 33
   gp_enc_alg = 34
   hkdf = 31
   HMAC-256-256 = 5
   AES-CCM-16-64-128 = 10

              Figure 2: CDDL model defining constants for e''

   Note that such a model can have other, unrelated CDDL rules that
   define more complex data items; only the ones used in an e''
   construct need to be constant values.

   Using the CDDL model in Figure 2, the example in Figure 1 can be
   notated as (example derived from Section 6.2-9 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-gm-admin]):

   {
       e'group_mode' : true,
       e'gp_enc_alg' : e'AES-CCM-16-64-128',
             e'hkdf' : e'HMAC-256-256'
   }

      Figure 3: Example updated to use e'constantname' for registered
                                 constants

   This example is equivalent to notating {33: true, 34: 10, 31: 5},
   which expresses the concise 10-byte data item that will actually be
   interchanged for this example.

   Note that the application-oriented literal does not itself define
   where the CDDL definitions it uses come from.  This information needs
   to come from the context of the example.

Implementation

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The e'' application extension is now implemented in the cbor-diag
   tools [cbor-diag], by the cbor-diag-e gem [cbor-diag-e], which can be
   installed as:

    gem install cbor-diag-e cddlc

   (cbor-diag-e uses cddlc [cddlc] internally, so it must be in PATH.)
   The provided

   Use of this extension has two prerequisites:

   1.  Opt-in to the application extension e, which in the cbor-diag
       tools such as diag2_x_.rb is done using the -a command line flag,
       here: -ae.

   2.  Identification of the CDDL model to be used, which will give the
       actual values for the constants.

       This can be a complete CDDL model for the application, no need to
       limit it just to constant definitions.  (Where the constant
       values need to be obtained by registration at the time of
       completion of the document using the examples, the CDDL model can
       be set up with TBD values of the constants to be assigned, and
       once they are, the necessary updates are all in one place.)

   Assuming that the example in Figure 3 is in a file called
   gmadmin.diag, and that the CDDL model that includes the constants
   defined in Figure 2 is in gmadmin.cddl, the following commands can be
   used to translate the e'` constants into their actual values:

   $ export CBOR_DIAG_CDDL=gmadmin.cddl
   $ diag2diag.rb -ae gmadmin.diag
   {33: true, 34: 10, 31: 5}

Provisional use

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The need for this application is there now, while ratification of the
   present specification might take a year or so.  Until then, each
   document using this scheme can simply use boilerplate such as:

   |  In the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, constructs
   |  of the form e’somename' are replaced by the value assigned to
   |  somename in CDDL in figure 0815.  E.g., {e'group_mode': "bar"}
   |  stands for {33: "bar"}.

   (Choose 0815, group_mode and 33 along the lines of the figure you
   include with the CDDL definitions needed.)

3.  The ref'' application extension: importing from EDN

Internet-Draft           EDN external references           December 2024


Problem

   Examples using CBOR diagnostic notation can get large.  One way to
   manage the size of an example is to make it incomplete.  This reduces
   the usefulness of the example for machine-processing.  It can also be
   misleading, unless the elision is made explicit (see Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]).

Solution

   In a set of CBOR examples, recurring subtrees can often be
   identified, the details of which do not need to be repeated in each
   example.

   By enabling examples to reference these subtrees from a separate
   piece of EDN, each example can focus on what is specific for them.

   The ref'' application-oriented literal enables composition by
   standing for a CBOR data item from a separate EDN instance that is
   referenced using its text as an identifier.

   So, for example, if 123.diag is a file containing

   [1, 2, 3]

   the result of the EDN

   [4711.0, true, ref’123.diag’]

   is

   [4711.0, true, [1, 2, 3]]

   The text of the literal can be one of two kinds of identifiers:

   1.  a file name to be interpreted in the context of the referencing
       example, as shown above, or

   2.  a URI that references the EDN to be embedded, as in

        [4711.0, true, ref'http://tzi.de/~cabo/123.diag']

      |  (ISSUE: We could use upper-case REF to unambiguously identify
      |  one of he two; the current implementation however just tries to
      |  parse the literal text as a URI and, if that fails, interprets
      |  it as a file name.)

Internet-Draft           EDN external references           December 2024


   Note that a ref'' application-oriented literal can only be used for a
   single CBOR data item; the extension point provided by EDN does not
   work for splicing in CBOR sequences.

Implementation

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The ref'' application extension is now implemented in the cbor-diag
   tools [cbor-diag], by the cbor-diag-ref gem [cbor-diag-ref], which
   can be installed as:

    gem install cbor-diag-ref

   For using the application extension, the cbor-diag tools such as
   diag2_x_.rb need to be informed by the -a command line flag, here:
   -aref.

   For experimenting with the implementation, the web resource
   http://tzi.de/~cabo/123.diag contains [1, 2, 3].  This example
   enables usage as in:

   $ echo "[4711.0, true, ref'http://tzi.de/~cabo/123.diag']" >my.diag
   $ diag2diag.rb -aref my.diag
   [4711.0, true, [1, 2, 3]]

   $ echo "[4, 5, 6]" >456.diag
   $ echo "[4711.0, true, ref'456.diag']" >my.diag
   $ diag2diag.rb -aref my.diag
   [4711.0, true, [4, 5, 6]]

   If a referenced EDN file parses as a CBOR sequence this is currently
   treated as an error.

Provisional use

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Documents that want to use the application extension ref'' now can
   use boilerplate similar to that given above for e''.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the following two assignments in the CBOR
   Diagnostic Notation Application-extension Identifiers registry
   [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation]:

   XXXX".


   // RFC Editor: please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   // RFC, [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation] with a reference to the new

5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8610], [RFC8949], and
   [I-D.bormann-t2trg-deref-id] apply.

   The proof of concept implementations described do not do any
   sanitizing of URLs or file names at all.  Upcoming versions of the
   present document will need to define the right restrictions for
   external references like this.
